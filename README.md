**facemeasure** democratizes facial landmark analysis by allowing anyone to extract precise facial metrics from images—no expensive software or coding skills needed. Upload facial images, visualize facial landmarks, and download results as CSV or JSON. Everything runs in your browser, and no personal data is stored!

## 🚀 Features

* **Facial Landmark Detection**: Instantly extract 68 facial landmarks from each face in your images using dlib’s shape predictor.
* **Batch Processing**: Upload and analyze multiple images at once.
* **Interactive Visualization**: See landmarks drawn and connected over each face (on grayscale or original images).
* **Download Results**: Export all detected landmarks as CSV or JSON.
* **Privacy-Friendly**: No images or data are ever stored—refresh the app to clear everything.
* **Free & Open Source**: Supported by the Social and Behavioural Data Science Centre, University of Amsterdam.
